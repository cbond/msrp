If you wish to build this, which is sort of a sketchy proposition unless you spend a little time setting up your development environment, you're going to need

  * boost, http://www.boost.org
  * boost asynchronous I/O, http://asio.sf.net
  * a recent resiprocate subversion checkout
  * gcc

For now you will have to place the msrp directory in resiprocate/msrp.

I will be removing the resiprocate dependency shortly as it makes no sense.
